I have created a very simple template for everyone to use. This template is generally created for programmers who want to track their Leetcode Progress.

This is a notion template for keeping track of your Leetcode question, This was made for people who arenâ€™t able to properly track their Leetcode Progress. This one of the best template ever made on Notion.

**What problems does the template address?**

By using this template, you can track your leetcode progress and challenge yourself again and again till you get better at Data Structures.

**How to use this template?**

All you have to do is make a duplicate for this template and then you can easily edit, modify and do whatever you want with it.

**Features of this template:**

- 100 days (you can add more)
- Add your Problems with Links
- Topic Selector
- Difficulty Selector
- Time & Space Complexity
- Programming Languages
- Time Tracker
- How much time it took to finish
- Progress Tracker
- Quick Links
- Notes - To add your notes for every single question
- Daily Motivational Quotes

**_The person who does one Leetcode question every single day regardless of how they feel will always beat the person who does it when they feel like doing it._**

**How does the template address these issues?**

It helps you think like a Sigma male/female and builds confidence.
